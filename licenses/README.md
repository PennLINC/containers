This directory is intended to contain licenses for different products which
might be used by the containers.  Following section names define the filenames
under which those licenses will be looked under.

Files in this directory will be ignored by Git, but if you would like, you
could keep them in your fork of this repository. You could also utilize
git-annex (and its unlocked mode in v7) to manage such sensitive data within
git without sacrificing privacy/security.
